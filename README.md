# SMART-PARKING
A project made with arduino to simulate a smart parking

This project was made in the subject of programmable systems during the summer of 2018.
The principal purpose was to make a smart parking capable of showing to the cars the number of spaces available and allowing them to enter
only if there are spaces available. Once the car has entered to the smart parking there is the possibility to see wich specific spaces are 
available thanks to the traffic lights that are put in each space. The idea is to show a red light if the space is not avaible, and a green
light if the space is available.
And finally, there is a spotlight that it is turned on when there is an absence of light so that when the night arrives it is still posible
to see everything.
